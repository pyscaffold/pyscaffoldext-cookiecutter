Using Cookiecutter templates with PyScaffold
============================================

`Cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org>`_ is a flexible framework
that allows the definition of templates for a diverse range of software
projects. On the other hand, PyScaffold is focused in a good out-of-the-box
experience for developing distributable Python packages (exclusively).
Despite the different objectives, it is possible to combine the power of both
tools to create a custom Python project setup. For instance, the following
command creates a new package named `mypkg`, that uses a Cookiecutter template,
but is enhanced by PyScaffold features:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ putup mypkg --with-cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage


Suitable templates
==================

Note that PyScaffold will overwrite some files generated by Cookiecutter,
like ``setup.py``, the ``__init__.py`` file under the package folder
and most of the ``docs`` folder, in order to provide
`setuptools_scm <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm>`_,
`pbr <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/pbr/>`_  and
`sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ integration.
Therefore not all Cookiecutter templates are suitable for this approach.

Ideally, interoperable templates should focus the file structure in the
package folder instead of packaging and distributing issues, since PyScaffold
already handles them under-the-hood. However, the following files can be
safely generated by a template (not overwritten)::

    <project root>/docs/index.rst
    <project root>/tests/conftest.py
    <project root>/README.rst
    <project root>/AUTHORS.rst
    <project root>/LICENSE.txt
    <project root>/CHANGES.rst
    <project root>/setup.cfg
    <project root>/requirements.txt
    <project root>/test-requirements.txt
    <project root>/.coveragerc

In addition, Cookiecutter runs under the **no_input** mode and thus the user
is not prompted for manual configuration. Instead, PyScaffold inject the
following parameters::

    author
    email
    project_name
    package_name
    project_short_description

Accordingly, the template file structure should be similar to::

    cookiecutter-something/
    └── {{cookiecutter.project_name}}/
        └── {{cookiecutter.package_name}}/
            └── ...

See `Cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org>`_ for more
information about template creation.
