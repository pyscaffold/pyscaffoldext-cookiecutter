==========================
pyscaffoldext-cookiecutter
==========================

    Extension that combines the flexibility of **Cookiecutter** templates
    with the power of **PyScaffold**.

`Cookiecutter`_ is a flexible utility that allows the definition of templates
for a diverse range of software projects.
On the other hand, `PyScaffold`_ is focused in a good out-of-the-box experience
for developing distributable Python packages (exclusively).
Despite the different objectives, it is possible to combine the power of both
tools to create a custom Python project setup.


Quickstart
==========

This extension can be directly installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyscaffoldext-cookiecutter

Or, if you prefer ``pipx``:

.. code-block:: shell

    pipx install pyscaffold  # if you haven't installed pyscaffold yet
    pipx inject pyscaffold pyscaffoldext-cookiecutter

Note that, after the installation, ``putup -h`` will show a new option
``--cookiecutter TEMPLATE``.
Use this option to point out which template you want to use (path or url).
The file structure created by `Cookiecutter`_ will be refined by PyScaffold
afterwards.
For example:

.. code-block:: shell

    putup my-proj1 --cookiecutter ~/my-templates/default
    putup my-proj2 --cookiecutter gh:something/from-github

Please refer to `Cookiecutter`_ documentation for more details on possible URLs
and abbreviations.

An additional option ``--cookiecutter-params`` is also added, so you can have
more control over the values `Cookiecutter`_ uses when rendering the templates
(PyScaffold will not run Cookiecutter's interactive prompt).
This option takes the form of a space separated list of ``NAME=VALUE``
arguments as showed in the example bellow:

.. code-block:: bash

    putup mypkg \
      --cookiecutter gh:pyscaffold/cookiecutter-pypackage \
      --cookiecutter-params command_line_interface=Argparse use_pytest=y

Check the ``cookiecutter.json`` file in the repository (or directory) of the template you are
using to see the available parameters.
Please notice PyScaffold already add some default parameters, as indicated in
the section **Suitable Templates** bellow.


Cookiecutter templates with PyScaffold
======================================

The following example shows how to create a new package named ``mypkg``,
that uses a Cookiecutter template, but is enhanced by PyScaffold's features:

.. code-block:: bash

    putup mypkg --cookiecutter gh:pyscaffold/cookiecutter-pypackage

This is roughly equivalent to first create a project using the Cookiecutter
template and convert it to PyScaffold afterwards:

.. code-block:: bash

    cookiecutter --no-input gh:pyscaffold/cookiecutter-pypackage project_name=mypkg
    putup mypkg --force

.. note::
   For complex Cookiecutter templates calling ``cookiecutter`` and ``putup``
   separately may be a better option, since it is possible to answer
   specific template questions or at least set values for Cookiecutter
   variables.

.. warning::
   Although using Cookiecutter templates is a viable solution to customize
   a project that was set up with PyScaffold, the recommended way is to help
   improve PyScaffold by contributing an `extension`_.


.. _suitable-templates:

Suitable templates
------------------

Note that PyScaffold will overwrite some files generated by Cookiecutter,
like ``setup.py``, the ``__init__.py`` file under the package folder
and most of the ``docs`` folder, in order to provide `setuptools_scm`_
and `sphinx`_ integration.
Therefore not all Cookiecutter templates are suitable for this approach.

Ideally, interoperable templates should focus on the file structure inside the
``src`` folder instead of packaging or distributing, since PyScaffold already
handles it under-the-hood. This also means that your template should adhere to
the src-layout if you want to generate files within your Python package.

In addition, PyScaffold runs Cookiecutter with the ``--no-input`` flag
activated and thus the user is not prompted for manual configuration. Instead,
PyScaffold injects the following parameters::

    author
    email
    full_name => same as author
    project_name => the name of the folder where the project will be generated
    repo_name => same as project_name
    package_name => putup's --package (as in `import`)
    namespace => putup's --namespace (if any)
    installable_name => putup's --name (an installable name, like in PyPI/pip install)
    project_short_description => putup's description
    release_date => equivalent to the day you are running putup
    year => equivalent to the year you are running putup

Any extra parameter should be passed using the ``--cookiecutter-params`` option.

Accordingly, the template file structure should be similar to::

    cookiecutter-something/
    └── {{cookiecutter.project_name}}/
        └── src/
            └── {{cookiecutter.package_name}}/
                └── ...

See `Cookiecutter`_ for more information about template creation.

.. note::
   PyScaffold uses Cookiecutter only for its ability to create files.
   Pre/post hooks that perform any other kind of side effect are not
   guaranteed to work.

Making Changes & Contributing
=============================

This project uses `pre-commit`_, please make sure to install it before making any
changes::

    pip install pre-commit
    cd pyscaffoldext-cookiecutter
    pre-commit install

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version::

    pre-commit autoupdate

Please also check PyScaffold's `contribution guidelines`_,
